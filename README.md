# ICT112DiscordBot
A Discord bot that tracks playtime of multiple users on a server.

This project is currently in a preproduction stage, nothing works yet and won't for a while.
Feel free to suggest any features for me to add in. I'm not a very good programmer so we'll see how that goes.

Currently main.py contains code from a tutorial by RealPython that I snatched to ensure my connection to discord was
working properly. It is not final and will be reworked from the ground up in the next commit.

In order for this code to run at the moment you will need to creat a .env file and make an entry called DISCORD_TOKEN,
then assign it the value of your own discord bot, found in the discord developer portal. For example:

# DISCORD_TOKEN={your discord token} 

Thanks for reading!
